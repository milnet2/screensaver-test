== Screensaver issue analyzer

Mission Statement:: Learn *go* and solve my *standby-issues* at the same time

CAUTION:: This is my first _go_ project and will likely never be finished!

=== Goal

This is a _learning-project_ for me, and I want to endeavour:

* Asynchronously
** By not using a Tutorial-example
** Behaving like `powertop` and update suggestions
* Interact with "lower level" stuff
** My go-to would be JVM and _go_ will be better for that
* Get to know how to manage "complex" projects the go-way
** I want to Accept a heterogeneous set of information-sources
** I want a plugin-like solution (without actually sideloading)

=== Approach

* The approach will *deliberately* be over-engineered
** The goal is for me to understand
** follow-along my current questions in xref:remarks.adoc[]
